Has it ever happened that when you went into a dungeon or trial you forgot to remove the wild hunt ring?
If yes, then this addon is for you!
He creates an icon on the screen when you are wearing a wild hunt ring. The icon starts blinking when you enter the dungeon, trial and etc.

Also, the addon allows you to quickly put on and take off the ring when you press a key that you must specify in the control settings.

If you still have questions, then I will be happy to answer them in the comments

Wild Hunt Helper supports English and Russian. But if you play in another language, just go to the add-on settings and set the ring name in your language there.
You can send the ring name in your language in the ESOUI comment.
